# pactime
A small game inspired by pacman, that I'm making since ninth grade in school. It is made using Python and its Tkinter library.

It started as a joke that I told to my informatics teacher when we were learning to use some basics of Python. I asked him if I will get a full grade in his subject the next year if I wrote the pacman game during the summer. He agreed, and I coded it. After that, I had full grade in informatics till the end of school.

Since then, as I was learning more and more about programming, I was improving this small game as my goto rest activity when I had spare time.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- Tkinter (built-in library)
- Recommended OS: Linux (not tested on Windows and macOS)

### How to launch
1. Get all the files (will write how to a bit later)
2. `cd <your_path>/pactime`
3. `python3 pactime.py`
4. Have fun ^_^
